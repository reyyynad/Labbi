## 💡 Project Overview

**Labbi (لبِّ)** – meaning *“the core / the essence”* in Arabic – is a beautiful, bilingual digital marketplace that connects **service providers** (especially students and skilled individuals) with **customers** who need trustworthy, affordable, high-quality services.

The platform solves a real-life problem:  
**“I need someone reliable and reasonably priced.”**  
Labbi empowers young providers to earn money and build reputation, while customers enjoy verified, reviewed, and safe services.
